# Create a program that asks the user to enter two numbers and displays:
# the sum, the difference, and the product between them.

number1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Arithmetic operations
sum_result = number1 + number2
difference = number1 - number2
product = number1 * number2

print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
